title: "Welcome to Bite-Sized Swift!"
layout: post

You might be thinking: "Another Swift blog - great!" I completely understand the hesitation, but the truth is that this blog is more for me than it is for you. A good friend of mine once told me that everytime he learns something new, he writes it down immediately to test his understanding.

That's what this blog is for.

My plan is to write a post every week, documenting my latest Swift adventures and findings. I am constantly trying to become a better iOS developer, and while there are tons of resources out there, I want to organize it so anyone can follow along. If you find that useful - great!  If not, no worries, there's plenty of other blogs out there. :)
